Take Snapshot
-------------

Take a new Snapshot in background. The main window can be closed during taking
the snapshot. You can alternative take a new Snapshot with ``checksums`` option
enabled. This will calculate checksums for every file to decide if the file has
changed. Normal behavior is to only compare  files size and modification time.
This takes a lot more time but it will make sure, the destination files won't
be corrupt.
